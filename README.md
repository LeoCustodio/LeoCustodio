# LeonardoCustodio

Always with the understanding that a good requirements analysis and business understanding in conjunction with a well-architected technology project can change the life of a project, I have always reconciled keeping up to date with the latest technology and seeking a good relationship with customers and products.

I have been working with technology since 2017, always working in constant contact with the end client allows me to understand the needs of the business, working individually and as a team.
Delivering codebase that adds value to the business.
